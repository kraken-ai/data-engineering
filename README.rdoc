== Basic app instructions.

1. This app uses the embedded sqlite db, all you need to do is start it up with: rails server
2. Your welcome to signup via devise, or you can login with: test@user.com / password
3. Didn't prep the app to be prod ready, since it's a demo.
4. You can rake db:setup if you like to clear things out, and sign-up again if you like.
5. There's an example spreadsheet in /test/data/example_input.tab
